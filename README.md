# STUDENT ATTENDANCE MANAGER

A basic Android app that helps students manage attendance for multiple subjects. It calculates attendance percentage and tells how many more classes you must attend to reach 75%, or the maximum possible percentage you can achieve.

## Features

- Mark classes as Present or Absent
- Shows:
  - Total, Present, and Absent classes
  - Current attendance percentage
- Forecast tool to:
  - Enter how many more classes will happen
  - See how many you must attend to reach 75%
